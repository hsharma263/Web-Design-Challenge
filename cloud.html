    <p>The results are rather inconclusive for city latitude vs cloudiness. There are several cites, at all latitudes, which 0% cloudiness.
        However, as you travel towards the equator, as well as away from the equator, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, there are sporadic data points. 
        Cities in the Northern Hemisphere, latitude 40 and greater, appear to be a bit cloudier as compared to other latitudes, however, more data is needed in order to obtain more conclusive results.
