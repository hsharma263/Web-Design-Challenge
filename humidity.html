    <p>
        It appears that humidity is not very dependent on city latitude, as data points are rather sporadic in relation to their latitude.
        Most cities in the dataset appear to have a humidity of 100%, with more being in the Northern Hemisphere than Southern.
        This may in part be due to the fact that the original dataset had more cities from the Northern Hemisphere than Southern.
        The greatest distribution of cities appears in humidity levels of 60% to 100%, across latitudes from -40 to 80.
