    <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>
    <p>The aim of this project was to examine various weather factors in relation to city distance from the equator, as measured by latitude.
        Factors examined included city max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Data was gathered using OpenWeatherMap API.
        Analysis was then performed on the data using Jupyter Notebooks in conjunction with Pandas. 
        Lastly, we used Matplotlib to generate plots, providing visualizations of the key findings.
