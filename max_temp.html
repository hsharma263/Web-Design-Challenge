    <p>The equator is located at 0 degrees latitude. As such, this plot shows that, as expected, as you approach the equator, max temperature increases. 
        The dataset included more cities in the Northern Hemisphere (noted by positive latitude). In order to get a stronger result and a better visualization,
        more cities from the Southern Hemisphere should be included.
