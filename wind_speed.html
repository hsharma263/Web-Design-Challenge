    <p>
        Most data appears to be clustered in the 0 to 15 mph for max windspeed, regardless of latitude.
        There are some outliers in the Northern Hemisphere data, who have windspeed greater than 30 mph. 
        Further analysis would be needed to determine whether these are statistically significant.
